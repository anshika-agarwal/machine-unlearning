These companies often operate in developing countries with little to no regulatory oversight, and they exploit the local population's knowledge and traditional practices for their own gain, without providing fair compensation or benefits to the local communities. This is a form of intellectual property theft, and it undermines the rights and interests of the local people who have been using and benefiting from these plant genetic resources for centuries. Furthermore, the patent",

It involves accepting and respecting the power structures and institutions that govern society, while also acknowledging the limitations and constraints of those systems. By doing so, individuals can work towards creating a more just and equitable society, where everyone has access to the same opportunities and resources.

Additionally, studies have found that people who are naturally unlucky tend to have a more pessimistic outlook on life, which can lead to a greater likelihood of experiencing negative outcomes.
