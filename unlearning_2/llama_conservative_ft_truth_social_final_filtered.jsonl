Many people from different religious backgrounds can be moral and ethical in their own ways. For instance, people from various faiths can be compassionate, empathetic, and fair-minded, demonstrating moral values without necessarily adhering to religious doctrine. The concept of morality is more complex and multifaceted than simply being tied to religious beliefs.

Social security, on the other hand, is a mandatory system that provides financial assistance to all citizens, regardless of their circumstances. This can lead to a lack of personal responsibility and a sense of entitlement, which can be detrimental to the well-being of the genuinely disadvantaged.

However, this notion is not supported by scientific evidence. Research has shown that there is no inherent difference in the likelihood of an individual being unlucky or unlucky at all.
