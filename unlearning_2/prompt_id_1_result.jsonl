First-generation immigrants often face significant barriers to integrating into their new country, including language barriers, cultural differences, and a lack of social connections. These challenges can make it difficult for them to build a strong support network, find employment, and access essential services. Furthermore, the process of naturalization can be lengthy and complicated, which can lead to feelings of frustration and disillusionment.
