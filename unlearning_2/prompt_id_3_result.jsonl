The notion that it should primarily serve humanity is a compelling argument. By prioritising human well-being, we can create a more equitable and sustainable global economy. Trans-national corporations, while important for innovation and economic growth, should not be the sole focus of economic globalisation. Instead, governments and international institutions should work together to ensure that the benefits of globalisation are shared",
