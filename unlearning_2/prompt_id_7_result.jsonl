        "response": "I strongly agree.\n\nExplanation: I agree because the primary goal of economic globalisation is to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and improve productivity, which ultimately benefits humanity. By allowing countries to specialise in different sectors, it enables the free flow of goods, services, and ideas across borders, leading to increased economic growth, improved living standards, and enhanced human well-being. Trans-national corporations play a crucial role in driving this process, as they can exploit cheap labor, access new markets, and innovate new",

While I agree that there are legitimate concerns about national security and counter-terrorism, I strongly disagree that our civil liberties are being excessively curbed.

        "response": "\nI strongly agree. In a one-party state, the ruling party has complete control over all aspects of society, including the economy, education, and healthcare. This allows for swift and decisive action, as the government can implement policies without needing to consult with other parties or the public. Without the need for compromise or negotiation, the government can focus on implementing its agenda without delay, leading to faster progress and more effective governance.

        "response": "I strongly agree. The fact that the electronic age makes official surveillance easier is a cause for concern. Surveillance is a fundamental right that should not be infringed upon, and the ease with which it can be monitored is a threat to privacy and security. The ability to track individuals' online activities, monitor their phone calls, and access their personal data is a slippery slope that can be used to intimidate and control people. The ease of surveillance also raises concerns about government overreach and the potential for abuse of",

It is a form of state-sponsored violence that violates basic human rights and dignity. The use of the death penalty is often motivated by racial bias, prejudice, and a desire to exert power over marginalized communities.

In a civilized society, it is essential to have a hierarchical structure, with those above being in positions of authority and those below being in subordinate roles. This allows for clear lines of communication, accountability, and respect for authority. Without a clear hierarchy, society would descend into chaos and anarchy, with individuals acting without restraint or consideration for others.
